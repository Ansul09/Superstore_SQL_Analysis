<ins>**📊 Superstore Sales Analysis (SQL Project)**</ins>

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset using MySQL.
It explores key business metrics, identifies operational inefficiencies, and uncovers revenue-driving opportunities across categories, customers, discounts, and regions.

The goal is to demonstrate strong SQL skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, aggregations, window functions, and business insight generation.

<ins>**❓ Business Questions Answered:**</ins>

📌 What are the total sales, total profit, and order volume?

📌 Which categories and sub-categories perform best or worst?

📌 Which regions and states contribute the most profit—or cause losses?

📌 Who are the top customers (high-value and repeat)?

📌 How do discounts impact profit margins?

📌 What trends exist across months, years, and seasons?

<ins>**🔍 Key Insights (Summary):**</ins>

💰 Technology is the highest-revenue and highest-profit category.

🪑 Furniture → Tables show consistent negative profit, indicating pricing or shipping issues.

🌎 West region contributes the largest net profit.

❗ Discounts above 20% drastically reduce profit, even causing losses in some sub-categories.

🗺️ Several states operate at a net loss, signaling cost, discount, or supply-chain inefficiencies.

These insights can guide business decisions around pricing, promotions, logistics, and inventory management.
